Robotic Hand with Computer Vision Control
This project introduces a novel design for a robotic arm equipped with five fingers, aiming to provide a highly dexterous and versatile solution for various industrial and domestic applications. The hand's design features a compact and lightweight construction, making it suitable for integration into various systems. The key innovation lies in the integration of computer vision technology to control the hand's movements, offering enhanced artificial dexterity.

Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to design and fabricate an animatronic hand for demonstrative and educational purposes while exploring potential applications. Furthermore, the project seeks to address the challenge of limited access to technical expertise in remote locations, particularly in high-skilled labor jobs, by enabling remote access to physical manipulation with high precision.

Objectives
The objectives of this project are as follows:

Creating a model hand operable from a distant location by detecting finger motions through computer vision.
Providing access to physical human expertise worldwide, facilitating scenarios such as remote surgeries.
Enhancing knowledge in the educational space of computer vision and Arduino programming.
Methodology
The methodology involves selecting the required hardware and software components, developing computer vision algorithms to detect finger movements, and integrating these with Arduino to control servo motors for the hand's movement. The process includes careful selection of components, development of codes, and correct integration of hardware.

Technology and Literature Survey
The project involves the detection of finger motions using computer vision, conversion of computer vision output for Arduino control, and processing of signals for servo motors. Hardware required includes servo motors, Arduino Uno, and the model hand, while software includes computer vision and Arduino code.

Design and Implementation
Schematic
The working logic of the system is as follows:

Finger movements in front of the camera are detected by the computer vision code.
The computer vision code generates an array of five numbers (0 for curved fingers, 1 for straight fingers) representing the movement of each finger.
This array is sent to the Arduino code, which processes the information.
Based on the input received from computer vision, the Arduino generates signals for the servo motors, causing the fingers to curl or remain still accordingly.
